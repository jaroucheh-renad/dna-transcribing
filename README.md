# DNA Transcribing

## Aim
I created this script using the Biopython library to perform the transcription step in DNA replication. It is designed for anyone interested in learning more about the use of computing in biology, allowing users to experiment with the analyzation of DNA sequences. This script can process DNA sequences to show how the mature RNA copy looks like after transcription.

## Key Features
- Basic DNA sequence parsing and manipulation.
- Visualization of DNA become mRNA after being transcribed.
- Introduction to computational biology using Python, Biopython and matplotlib.

## What you should already have
- Python (I use version: 3.11)
- Biopython library
- Matplotlib library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jaroucheh-renad/dna-transcribing.git
   cd dna-transcribing
   ```

2. Install required packages:
  ```
  pip install biopython
  pip install matplotlib

  ```
3. Running the script
   ```
   python test2.py
   ```
